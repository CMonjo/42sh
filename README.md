# minishell1


Epitech's minishell1 project in C language. 


For this project it's necessary to reproduce a Shell with Linux command management. We had to copy tcsh who is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C.

## Requirements

 * [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make//)
 * [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
 * [CSFML 2.3] (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

## Compilation

Navigate to the root of the repository from your Terminal and run make to build the 42sh executable file.

## How to

./42sh

for more informations about builtins, type "builtins" into the shell.

## Bonus

- Termcaps.
- Command line in graphic interface.
- Prompt color.
- Alias pre-set.
- Ascii builtin.
